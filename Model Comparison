 # Creating a complete code for model comparison requires a specific dataset, machine  # learning libraries, and thorough implementation, which might be too extensive for a single response. However, I can provide you with a basic outline in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning and pandas for data manipulation. You will need to adapt this code to your specific dataset and requirements. #
 
 # Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Load your dataset (replace 'your_dataset.csv' with your actual dataset)
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Assuming the last column is the target variable and the rest are features
X = data.iloc[:, :-1]
y = data.iloc[:, -1]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Define models
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(),
    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    'Support Vector Machine': SVC(),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier()
}

# Train and evaluate each model
results = {}
for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    results[name] = {
        'Accuracy': accuracy,
        'Precision': precision,
        'Recall': recall,
        'F1 Score': f1
    }

# Display the results
for name, metrics in results.items():
    print(f"\n{name} Metrics:")
    for metric, value in metrics.items():
        print(f"{metric}: {value:.4f}")
